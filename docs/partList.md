| Image                                     | Name          |
| ------------------------------------------| ------------------ |
| ![Maker Uno](images/component/MakerUno.jpg)   | Microcontroller (Maker Uno) <span title="The Maker Uno is like the brain of your project. It's a tiny computer that follows your instructions and makes things happen. Imagine it as the conductor of an orchestra, telling each part what to do.">ℹ️</span> |
| ![USB Cable](images/component/usbCable.jpg)   | Micro USB Cable <span title="This is the cable that connects the Maker Uno to a computer or power source. It's like the power cord for your project, helping it come to life.">ℹ️</span>|
| ![Breadboard](images/component/Breadboard.jpg)| Breadboard <span title="The breadboard is like the stage where all the electronic parts gather to perform. It lets us experiment with different parts without needing to glue them together.">ℹ️</span>|
| ![Jumper Cables](images/component/JumperCable.jpg)| Jumper Cable <span title="Jumper cables are like the pathways that connect different parts on the stage (breadboard). They help parts talk to each other and work together.">ℹ️</span>|
| ![LEDs](images/component/led.jpg)             | Assorted LED <span title="LEDs are like tiny flashlights for your project. They light up when the Maker Uno tells them to, creating beautiful colors and effects.">ℹ️</span>|
| ![220-ohm Resistor](images/component/resistor220.jpg)| Resistor 220 Ohm <span title="The 220-ohm resistor is like a traffic cop for electricity. It helps control the flow so that the LEDs don't get too much power and stay safe.">ℹ️</span>|
| ![1K-ohm Resistor](images/component/resistor1k.jpg)| Resistor 1K Ohm <span title="The 1K-ohm resistor is like a helper for the electricity. It makes sure everything gets just the right amount of power to work well together.">ℹ️</span>|
| ![10K-ohm Resistor](images/component/resistor10k.jpg)| Resistor 10K Ohm <span title="The 10K-ohm resistor is another helper for electricity. It's often used in special jobs, like helping the Maker Uno talk to sensors.">ℹ️</span>|
| ![Push Button](images/component/pushButton.jpg)| Push Button Switch <span title="The push button is like a magical switch. When you press it, it tells the Maker Uno to do something special, like turning on a light or making a sound.">ℹ️</span>|
| ![Potentiometer](images/component/Potentiometer.jpg)| Potentiometer <span title="The potentiometer is like a volume knob for your project. It helps control how bright the lights are or how loud the sounds can be.">ℹ️</span>|
| ![IR Sensor](images/component/irSensor.jpg)| IR Sensor <span title="The IR sensor is like a superhero with a special power – it can see things that our eyes can't. It's often used for secret missions, like detecting invisible signals.">ℹ️</span>|
| ![Ultrasonic Sensor](images/component/ultrasonic.jpg)| Ultrasonic Sensor <span title="The ultrasonic sensor is like a bat with super hearing. It uses sound waves to find out how far away things are, helping our projects avoid obstacles.">ℹ️</span>|
| ![Transistor](images/component/transistor.jpg)| Transistor <span title="The transistor is like a tiny robot. It helps control the flow of electricity and is crucial for making our projects do more advanced tasks.">ℹ️</span>|
| ![Diode](images/component/Diode.jpg)         | Diode <span title="The diode is like a one-way street for electricity. It ensures that the electrical traffic only goes in the right direction, keeping things organized.">ℹ️</span>|
| ![Motor](images/component/Motor.jpg)         | Motor <span title="The motor is the muscle of our project. When the Maker Uno says, 'Move!' the motor starts spinning or moving something, bringing our creations to life.">ℹ️</span>|
| ![Propeller](images/component/Propeller.jpg)| Propeller <span title="The propeller is like the fan on an airplane. It spins around and helps our projects move through the air, making them soar and glide.">ℹ️</span>|
