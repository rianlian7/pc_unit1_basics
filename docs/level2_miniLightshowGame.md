## 🚦 Step 4 — Traffic Light Simulation
Now simulate a **traffic light system** using this code.  
Make sure the pin connections are:

- **Pin 4 → Green LED**  
- **Pin 5 → Yellow LED**  
- **Pin 6 → Red LED**

## 🔁 Step 5 — Running Light (LED Chase)
Create a **Running Light** effect (also known as the *Knight Rider* or *LED Chase*).  
Choose any LED colors you like.

**Concept:**  
LEDs light up one by one from left to right, then back again — repeating continuously.
