# About Page

This self-guided book draws inspiration from the Arduino Learning Guide for Beginners by Cytron Technologies. While the foundation of this guide aligns with their work, it diverges by utilizing mBlock block programming instead of Arduino C programming for a different learning approach.

Additionally, some images featured in this guide have been sourced from various places to enhance visual clarity and comprehension. Credit goes to the original creators of these images, and their contributions are duly appreciated.

If any original creators find that the use of their images in this guide requires permission, or if they prefer not to have their images included, kindly inform me. I am committed to respecting intellectual property rights, and I will promptly remove any content upon request.
