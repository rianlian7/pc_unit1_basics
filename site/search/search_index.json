Download and install mBLock 5 into your computer. Once you installed, launch mBlock 5 from the Start Menu or from your Desktop. The user interface will look something like this Let's add the Arduino UNO into the device section . Make sure Arduino Uno device is selected in the devices section . Then click Connect You will see this pop-up menu, if it shows \"No device can be detected...\", then check Show all connectable devices . Select the right COM device and click Connect . If you are unsure if that is the Maker Uno, disconnect all USB devices except the Maker Uno. Your Devices section should look like this. Task 3 - Switching between Live and Upload mode In mBlock, there are two modes we use: Live mode and Upload mode. Live : This is when your code runs right away on the device. Remember to \"Update Firmware\" every time you switch to Live Mode. Upload : Your code only runs when you click the button. You can change the mode through this Mode Switch toggle. When switching to Live coding, you will have to \"Update Firmware\". Switch to Live mode Click Update Firmware Click Updates We will often switch between Live and Upload mode throughout this unit. Remember to \"Update Firmware\" every time we switch to Live mode.
